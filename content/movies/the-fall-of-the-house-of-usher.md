title = "The Fall of the House of Usher"
added = "2020-12-31"
description = "In a decaying castle surrounded by a dank, mirrored lake live the morbidly nervous Roderick Usher and his sickly twin sister, Madeline. Their tale is told and dimly comprehended by the unnamed narrator, a boyhood friend whom Roderick has summoned. When Madeline soon dies—or seems to die—they entomb her body. On a stormy night, \"cracking and ripping\" sounds and a \"shriek\" from below convince the panicky Roderick that \"We have put her living into the tomb!\" The shrouded, emaciated figure of Madeline appears at the door of Roderick's book-strewn study, falls upon him, \"and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse.\""
