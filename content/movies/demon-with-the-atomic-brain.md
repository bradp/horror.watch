description = "An attempt to weaponize a machine capable of opening portals to other worlds fails, and instead creates an exponentially expanding \"bubble\" of fractured space-time. A team of specialists must enter the disturbance and make their way down a rabbit hole of increasingly more dangerous alternate realities in the hopes of finding and shutting down the machine which created it. However, someone-or SOMETHING-seems determined to stop them before the \"bubble\" engulfs the entire universe itself."
